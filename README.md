### Reflections and Comments

Issues with footer and rerendering totals worked out in class, but I can only follow along until the cities.push part. Still unsure why it has push 2xfor the totals to add up correctly. Also need to clean up my CSS and implement flexbox. Still working on fully understanding that before I proceed further.
